# ContinuumRobotExamples

Continuum robots have elastic links which are capable of large-scale continuous deformations. This repo has example scripts to simulate continuum robots of various design paradigms. Each example is accompanied by a short write-up in PDF format.

## Motivation

* Introduce continuum robot modeling
* Demonstrate advanced concepts such as dynamic simulation
* Disseminate published academic results

Continuum and soft robotics problems can have a steep learning curve. The mechanics of robot motions are described by differential equations. Controlling a robot may depend on writing a simulation loop to numerically solve for robot behavior at interactive rates. Although there is fundamental complexity which is difficult to generalize in software, this repo aims to provide an easier path with examples as learning aids.
